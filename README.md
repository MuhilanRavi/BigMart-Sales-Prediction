# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
BigMart Sales Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the sales of various products across BigMart stores using historical data. The goal is to build a regression model that forecasts Item_Outlet_Sales based on product and store attributes, helping optimize inventory and improve sales strategies.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle BigMart Sales Dataset

Size: 8523 records with 12 columns

Features include:

Product info: Item_Identifier, Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type, Item_MRP

Store info: Outlet_Identifier, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type

Target variable: Item_Outlet_Sales (continuous sales value)

Data Exploration & Cleaning
Loaded dataset using pandas.

Identified and handled missing data in Item_Weight and Outlet_Size.

Imputed missing weights with the mean, and outlet sizes with the mode.

Visualized distributions of key categorical variables and numeric features.

Feature Engineering & Encoding
Converted categorical variables into numeric codes using Label Encoding for compatibility with sklearn models.

Prepared feature matrix X and target vector y.

Model Development
Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets with fixed randomness (random_state=42).

Trained a Random Forest Regressor with 100 trees.

Evaluated model performance on test data.

Model Evaluation
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~1080.82

RÂ² Score: 0.57 (57% of sales variance explained by the model)

Usage
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository

Install dependencies (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
